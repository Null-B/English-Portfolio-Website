I had a realy fun summer, I had a lot to do and it felt relay full. I never got the felling that I was bored or that I had notight to do. But my summer was also short. I realy miss the sek summers that went longer and event the summer that I had as a kid in macedonian 3 mouths of summer break. 


I relay cant descripe my summer with high and lows because it was sp much. So ill give a short rundown.


Went to croatia realy liked the cirystal clear watter and the clif side beachs. We rearly go to clif side beaces last time we were in such a spot was 7 years ago in grece. What was special about reijaka the cirty that we were staying it is a major port for european trade so we were swimining and watching containier ships moving by



Aftter that we went to my second home in macedonia, I lived in the city for 4 years and we went there to get work done, like get new numbers and pickup some documents. Almost evrythign has to be done in the capital beucase it’s the biggest population hotspot in macedonia and only the city makes up 1/4 of the whole contry

What was very nice is that I got to celebrate on of my close friends birtday, we know each other since 4th grade and he was the first person that I spoke to at school when I moved




Then to my gradparents and my home town. There was not a lot to do, its is a small town to the foot of the moutnatn, and even in the summer it only reaches a size of 1000 pepole. 

What I mostly did there was going to wedings, I had back to back wedings planed, from close family to other relatives. And that takes up the whole day, it was realy fun tho because I have a a lot of cousins and we don’t get to see each other very often and it’s a perfect time to sozilice and get up to date.

Here is a video of when the groom's family gose to the bride to pick her up.







And for a whole culture change I wnet to a couppel of festivals, this one was directly aftter summer breack and I realy fet the change form small town vibe to the big city life of zurich I like both and it has to have a balance.

This was my summer, I hope for a even funner and crazyer year.
