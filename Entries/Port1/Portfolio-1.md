# Protfolio 1 Summer Description
I had a really fun summer! There was always something to do, and it felt full and lively. I never once felt bored or like I had nothing going on. At the same time, my summer felt short. I really miss the long summers we used to have—especially the three-month breaks I had as a kid in Macedonia.

It’s hard to describe my summer in terms of highs and lows because there was just so much happening. So instead, I’ll give a quick rundown:

First, I went to Croatia. I loved the crystal-clear water and the cliffside beaches. We rarely get to go to those kinds of spots—the last time was seven years ago in Greece. What made Rijeka, the city we stayed in, special was that it’s a major European port. While we were swimming, we could watch massive container ships passing by, which was a unique experience.

After that, I went to my second home in Macedonia. I lived in the capital city for four years, and we went there mostly to get practical things done, like getting new phone numbers and picking up documents. Almost everything has to be handled in the capital because it’s the country’s biggest population center, making up nearly a quarter of Macedonia’s population.

One of the best parts of being there was celebrating my close friend’s birthday. We’ve known each other since 4th grade—he was actually the first person I spoke to when I moved to that school—so it was really special to be there.

Then I spent some time with my grandparents in my hometown. It’s a small town at the foot of the mountains, and even in summer it only reaches about 1,000 people. There wasn’t much to do there, but I went to a lot of weddings—sometimes back-to-back. They took up the whole day, but I had a great time because I got to see so many of my cousins. We don’t meet often, so weddings are the perfect chance to socialize and catch up.

Here’s a video of the groom’s family going to pick up the bride—a tradition I really enjoyed seeing.

And finally, for a complete change of atmosphere, I went to a couple of festivals. One of them was right after summer break ended, and I really felt the contrast between the small-town vibe and the big-city life in Zurich. I enjoy both, and I think there has to be a balance between them.

That was my summer! I’m hoping for an even more exciting and adventurous year ahead.
